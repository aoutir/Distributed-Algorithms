# Distributed-Algorithms
The goal of this practical project is to implement certain building blocks necessary for a decentralized system. To this end, some underlying abstractions will be used:

* Perfect Links 
* Best-effort Broadcast
* Uniform Reliable Broadcast
* FIFO Broadcast 
* Lattice Agreement

This project was done as part of the course CS-451 at EPFL.
